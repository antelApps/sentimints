The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \"parlor\" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \"weather report\" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

It is a sleek, newish building with the cool, polished feel that most Westin's throw down. The Ember Grille was nearly empty at dinnertime, and the environment was cold and stark. You would think something with \"ember\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \"10\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay. The staff was all very pleasant with the exception of the disinterested waiter in the bar; strangest service I may have ever encountered. I think maybe he was trying to pull off some sort of NYC attitude schtick in Charlotte. It was amusing at least. Nice stay, nice location.

I did not utilize this, but other coworker's utilized this opportunity.\n\nWe had our meeting within one of the conference rooms at the hotel. It was nice (modern), although as is usually the case, the room grew too cold on occasion, which was addressed by our staff, but with no noticeable difference.\n\nI noticed each morning, that our facilitator was met by the hotel staff to review the day's agenda, which I was very impressive. \n\nThe rooms were nice.

The doormen are always there opening the doors, I am always asked if I need help carrying all my ish, the breakfast menu is amazing ( I personally order the oatmeal - it comes with a sliced banana caramelized on top, and the mixed fruit - blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries!) , the breakfast buffet is equally good, and the staff are always smiling and thanking me for staying there. The beds are amazing and the dual shower heads is a major plus. The most amazing part about this hotel is when I come by at 5:45am on Monday they ALWAYS have a room available where I can check in to, drop off my stuff, crash for a few hours and get ready for work (avoiding the whole get ready in an airport bathroom shenanigans). \n\nThe only two reasons why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because 1) The gym only has three ellipicals, they are outdated and one has a TV which doesn't work (everyone else raved about the gym, maybe i just have high expectations) and 2) the room service dinner menu kind of sucks. The only thing worth getting is the vegetable quesadilla with chicken.

FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember,\" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

For some, it might seem too 'far' from downtown (3 blocks), but for me it's in great location. Walk to everything, including the Stadium, Convention Center, Downtown, and the Epicenter. \n\nService is great - I would expect it! It's the Westin! From the time you get out of a scorching hot taxi (even with air conditioning on) up until the time you leave at 6 in the morning 3 days later. I haven't experience a single hiccup (except a spider in my bathtub that scared the hell out of me one night). \n\nAmenities are great:\n\nRoom - 4 stars. Last time I was here, I got a room with a great walking shower bathroom. This time, it was the regular small bathroom. Last time, my friend managed to get a room with a treadmill (yes, they exist!), this time they were all sold out. I got stuck on the 6th floor, she got stuck on the fourth floor. This was an upgrade for me, as last time I was on the 4th floor as well. Ok, enough bitching. The rooms are great. Beds are called heavenly for a reason and all the condiments and towels and sheets are so fresh you feel energized be mere being in the room. Air Conditioning is a bit loud so either turn if off for the night or bring ear plugs.\n\nGym - 5 stars. From the variety of the workout options to the gym facilities - everything screams class. Perfectomundo! Individual TV screens for every machine (bike, elliptical, treadmill) help time pass by while working out and watching \"True Blood\" on HBO. Hmmm. Plenty of channels to choose from, though. Sauna, showers, and the locker room are squeaky clean with plenty of extra shampoo, lotion and mouth wash.\n\nPool - 3 stars. Even though this is a great big lap pool, it's too shallow - only 3  1/2 feet deep. I understand that they don't want kids to drown there if unattended, but come on, waist-deep pool is not very appealing to me.\n\nEmber Grill - 4 stars. I have only been here for breakfast - I can't complain, except for the prices. $18 for breakfast is a little steep. However, you can eat all you want from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and nobody will kick you out (not that I have done that, I swear!).\n\nBusiness Center - 1 star. Ok, what they call a business center is actually a 50 square foot room with 3 workstations, a printer and a fax machine. Internet is pay-per-minute, except to check in on your airline's website and print the boarding pass (which was actually all I needed from the Business Center). However, for travelers who actually need a business center - better bring the laptop and stay in your room with $12.95/day internet service.\n\nAirport Transportation - 5 stars. Checking out at 4 a.m.? Take advantage of the flat rate towncar that will take you directly to the airport. Air-conditioned bliss!\n\nOk, let's summarize: I would give this hotel a solid 4 stars and would definitely stay here again.

I left a New Tempur-Pedic pillow in the room and called the hotel to recover it. Each time I was transfered  to the security desk and they requested I call back later and see if housekeeping had turned the pillow in. After about 5 or 6 calls they did say they found the pillow and I had to give my credit card info to get it shipped to me.  It was not my pillow.  I called management and received a curt response that they would refund the shipping charges. (but they have still not done this 3 weeks later).

I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.\n\nI'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.\n\nThe rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.\n\nI also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.\n\nMy only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.\n\nExpect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.

Also, the driveway can get a bit crowded when trying to pick up, drop off or just get into the self-park area.   During our last visit,  Michael Jordan was staying here.  The hotel staff parked his car in the drive next to the bellman, so it could be watched around the clock, which made the small driveway to pick up & drop off guests even smaller.

Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.\n\nFor a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.\n\nThe staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.\n\nInternet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.\n\nThe gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a \"refresh area\" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.\n\nAs for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference.  Caterting was done right near the escalators.\n\nI didn't eat the restaurants on location since most of the meals were taken care of by the conference but I did check it price... and I would definitely venture out and explore the city a bit.  For the same price, I could probably check out a nice steakhouse around the area.\n\nWould definitely try to stay here again next time if I'm able to visit Charlotte again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

Around 4:15, my boyfriend got out of bed, went downstairs & pleaded for some assistance.  Again, he was told that security would come.  No one came.  Around 4:30 / 4:45 AM, he called the front desk again & was told the issue was \"pending & that meant it was taken care of\". Unfortunately, \"pending\" in normal circumstances does not mean \"taken care of\".  My boyfriend waited at our door to ensure someone was in fact coming to handle this noise complaint.

The fitness facility has a \"club\" feel with its low light, and has a good variety of equipment, ample mats, weighted balls, and stability balls.  What it's missing is a good machine for lats, but other than that, it's better than most hotel gyms.\n2.  That darn bed is so comfortable I can't even stand it.\n3.

A horrible, putrid, over-the-top, overpowering lavender-y spell is that so perfurme-y and strong that I literally coughed all the way down the hall to my room.  Having this be your welcome to your room?  I think not.  I held my breath the rest of the week.  \n2.  The service in the lounge of the hotel is virtually nonexistent.

This still seems expensive, but it was a popular weekend so we didn't shop around much more.\n\nThe wait for the elevators was ridiculous! I guess that there's not much that can be done about such a thing, but waiting for 10 minutes at a time because every elevator that stops is FULL TO THE BRIM with people was annoying. At once point, my husband took the stairs back to our room WHICH WAS ON THE ELEVENTH FLOOR after visiting the Starbucks in the lobby. Oh, and it's not a full Starbucks so they didn't even have iced coffee...???\n\nThe room was nice- we were on the end of a hallway, which I had heard was good because of the views and tons of windows. There were a ton of windows, but they overlooked construction and highways. Meh. The shower/bathtub situation was pretty awesome, also with tons of windows (there were shades, if you wished to pull them down!). There seemed to be no fan in the bathroom, though, which surprised me. \n\nAlso, there was a burnt out bulb in the bathroom, right near the magnifying mirror; when we called down to the front desk to have it replaced they said it would take them a while...and it did. Also, this is a small thing, but they put lotion in the shower instead of shampoo (next to the conditioner). So I washed my hair with lotion. Yeah.\n\nWe visited the bar on Saturday night between 10 and 11 and it was insane. It took us 40 minutes to get a drink, which we expected, but people behind us were being served first! I guess that's our fault for not being savvy enough to know how to get served in bars? Also, one bartender with red curly hair was making drinks kind of ridiculously- packing more ice in when she ran out of something and choosing things at random to pour in the glasses. We were glad the the person who finally served us (our overpriced cocktails) seemed to be measuring a little more carefully.\n\nA few more details: Parking is $18 and they bill it to your room; pretty standard for a downtown Charlotte hotel, but not exactly a welcome charge on your bill. The pool is inside. Someone on Yelp said that there is a rooftop bar at the Westin, but they must have gotten rid of it because we were told there was no such thing when we asked.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I prefer the Courtyard Marriot a few blocks over, on Tryon.

One bartender in particular (and I forgot his name, sorry), on my last night of stay, gave me free drinks, which was very kind of him.  \nThe gym was clean and spacious, and also empty most of the time, which I loved. \nThe wireless internet, on the other hand, was unnecessarily expensive ($15 per day? WHY??) and slow. \nI used their room service for breakfast twice (I was feeling lazy)- also tasty and you can find \"healthier\" options on the menu. \nTheir Starbucks in the lobby, however, was closed a lot of times, and the closest coffee place was about five blocks away, which was a bummer..\nBut all in all, if I ever make it back to Charlotte again, I would most likely stay at the Westin again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

Westin hotels are also known for their comfortable beds though I personally do not notice much of a difference compared to Marriotts.  The Westin in Downtown Charlotte definitely delivered on Westin's contemporary image and comfortable rooms.\n\nThe rooms are not incredibly modern, but they are contemporary and have a simple and good neutral color scheme.  The design is definitely a notch above a lot of Marriotts that often feature an unappealing color scheme and ugly carpets.  The bed at this Westin was comfortable--excellent linen too and a comfortable room temperature.  The bathroom had a great look and featured a rainfall showerhead.  While I do not have status with Starwood, I did like the nice touch of two complimentary bottles of water with each night (it seems every Starwood member, even non-elite members, enjoy this benefit).\n\nThis Westin also has a great location.  It is right on College, which leads to several Downtown Charlotte restaurants and even some of Charlotte's nightlife like a dance club and a dueling piano bar.  This Westin is also within walking distance to several key Charlotte attractions including a minor league baseball stadium, the Carolina Panthers (NFL) stadium, the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) arena, and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nThe fitness center was big and had several machines.\n\nThe lobby was nice too.  It was spacious and there were several sitting areas if you are waiting for someone.\n\nI tried a little bit of their catering for a nightly event in their restaurant as well as in one of their banquet rooms for breakfast.  The food was definitely subpar for a Westin.  A lot of it was due to poor preparation and the effects of having buffet style food as the scrambled eggs were not that fluffy, the waffles were very soft and the flatbread was limp (it had definitely been sitting around for too long).\n\nService throughout the hotel was friendly though I felt that housekeeping was a tad slow to service my room on some days.\n\nPrices are high, but the hotel is nice and the location is very convenient.\n\nFor travelers looking to explore Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a great option.  The rooms are nice and the location is near perfect.  Downtown Charlotte is not my favorite downtown city.  It is a tad sleepy though not as quiet as Phoenix or as small as San Jose.  However, if you need to be in Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a good hotel for a short or long stay.\n\nPay valet and self parking are both offered by this Westin.

I must say it was hard to leave! \n\nHotel:\n\nThe Westin is right in Uptown located across from the Convention Center and next to a light rail station, The Epicentre is only a 10-minute walk away (yes, we braved the cold, but it was nice!), and the arena is another few minutes from there. You can pay $25 for valet parking or $18 to self-park (which we did).\n\nThe lobby area was nice, and check-in was smooth. There is a mini-Starbucks there and a gift/sundries shop around the corner. The elevator bank has six elevators, so we didn't have to wait long (except when we ran into the ACN International Convention attendants coming back from the arena!).\n\nRestaurant/Food Service:\n\nWe didn't eat at the restaurant or indulge in food service, but apparently the breakfast buffet isn$25 per person! If you're here on a Sunday like we were, check out Pike's Soda Shop (a five-minute drive away in South End) for their amazing breakfast and breakfast buffet for $8.95 (before 10am--after that it's $13.95, but they add more food).\n\nRoom:\n\nWe booked a corner Superior room on the 23rd floor with gorgeous views of Uptown. It faced north and east, so the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. There is a nice-sized TV, individual thermostat, a desk with chair, an armchair with ottoman, a mini-fridge, and a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. They even threw in two free bottles of water (but don't consume the third, or it's $3.95). We didn't hair any noise from neighbors besides one instance of dogs barking (yes, the Westin is pet friendly). If you choose no housekeeping each day you're there (excluding day of departure), you get hooked up with a $5 dining voucher you can keep (or you can exchange that for 500 Starwood points when you check out). We initially had a problem with a non-functioning remote for the TV, but they sent someone up within 15 minutes and took care of it. Also beware that Wifi isn't free, but I believe if you're an SPG member you may not have to pay.\n\nBed:\n\nThe Heavenly Bed definitely lived up to its name! It was extremely comfortable and hard to get out of. The pillows were a little too soft for my taste, but if you love very soft pillows you're in for a treat! The duvet and sheets are comfortable as well. If you have a corner room, be aware there is a window right behind the bed. It wasn't a big deal with the blackout curtains.\n\nBathroom:\n\nThe bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom (no exhaust fan, unfortunately). The Heavenly Shower was awesome! It's both a rainfall-type shower, and there is a nice handheld component to it. My only gripe was the bathtub didn't drain well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all we had an amazing stay! I highly recommend this hotel. This was our second time staying here, and we will definitely return. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

The only positive is that the bed itself was comfortable - would have been nice to have that King bed though, of course. \n\nMany of the hotel staff seemed rude and inappropriate in situations - including the onsite Hertz staff. Obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location. Plus I had went to the front desk to get my key card \"keyed\" for use in the parking garage because I had rented a car there, but they couldn't even manage to get this right. I never could get the key card to work in the parking garage. \n\nConference rooms were poorly set-up, freezing cold, and loud! The walls were paper thin and it was at times very difficult to hear the presentations because sound from the other presentations next door would drift through - this was especially a problem in the back of the conference rooms. Attendees often were left standing at the back of the room because not enough chairs were set up.\n\nPerhaps for Charlotte this is a nice property, but for those of us who have traveled around a bit, this place falls very far short on the luxury scale. If you are in Charlotte for travel and have an option to choose where to stay, I'd recommend the much nicer looking Hilton down the street - that's a nice looking property and Hilton is always good. \n\nNot recommended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

Since arriving here for the first time for a convention in 08', followed b subsequent conventions and business meetings, the Westin Charlotte has been a welcoming accommodation that continues to leave an impression after each visit.\n\nThe first impression easily was the Heavenly beds. I've never slept in a better bed in a hotel prior to this visit, nor since. This bed set the benchmark so high with me that I purchased a comparable model a couple of years later at a pretty penny. The rooms within the Westin Charlotte are standard Westin: a littler smaller than expected, with the bed dominating a good portion of the space. The standard amenities of the pool area, gym and so forth met expectations. The front desk staff is very, very good, in addition to the banquet staff when it comes to accommodating colleagues that are in for a convention. \n\nThe bar area across the floor from the front desk is one of my favorite places to network with professionals as much as I do drink. Known as \"The Lobby Bar\", the area is set up strictly as one to rendezvous with business associates and friends during events primarily after 5 PM. The menu is moderately reasonable for beer drafts, yet a little pricier for hors d' oeuvres and cocktails. If you can get your company to approve drinks and appetizers under T&E, it is highly advised. \n\nParking is so-so. While the convenience to park within the underground lot is appreciated, I really think that it should be marked better with regard to where the elevator is in relation to the section of where your car is. It took me nearly 20 minutes to find my car at one point!\n\nAltogether, the Westin Charlotte can be a place to really enjoy. A little pricey, yet worth it if you prefer a downtown (they call it uptown in Charlotte) location while either traveling or on business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"},

I didn't see a single cockroach.\n\nLike any large metro hotel you'll see a interesting variety of people - business peeps for a conference, kids on a tour all wearing the same coordinated clothes, and random weirdos (like me). And of course on the right weekend when there is a game - lots of Cowboys fans. People watching is a sport in itself - all the tarted up ladies (welcome to The South y'all) and kids freaking out.\n\nLets talk about the bar.

I'm gonna like this place, I thought - I wonder if the locals come here knowing the drinks are strong. But alas... the SECOND night I ordered a whisky sour and it was basically sour mix. When I subsequently ordered a double it came back with a shot floating in the top and... wait for it.... the charge was $24. Yep, you read that right - they charged me for TWO drinks (and for some reason added on a $2/drink charge). \n\nI asked for snacks, and they served me some peanut things that were wet. I guess the dish was still wet from the dishwasher. So it was soggy snacks.\n\nAnd finally, one of my drinks was served in a hot glass (straight from the washer??)

(It's saved me more than once when, say, I realize that I forgot to grab my umbrella and have to run back into my apartment.) \n\nThe main problem is when there are holes in the schedule where a scheduled bus just never arrives, probably due to technical problems. That's happened to me at least once per month, but it's not so pervasive as to be a major issue.\n\nAll in all, I've found the buses to be dependable and convenient. Pittsburgh has punishingly complex topography- it's full of craggy valleys, towering hills, and plenty of rivers and streams- so considering that there's nothing even CLOSE to a grid system, it's a major accomplishment to have a mass transit system set up so smoothly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"},

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\"Miss Pat\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \"free\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \"oughts\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \"busways,\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \"T\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \"smart card\" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"},

Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  \n2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching\n3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.\n\nPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!

I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university, in an effort to accommodate out-of-state students as much as possible, provided \"free\" bus passes (these were factored into your cost of attending). With my full scholarship and pass, I had every intention of keeping this trip on the cheap by walking everywhere I could and using public trans for everything else.\n\nMy first experience with the Port Authority was taking the 28X Airport Flyer from the International Airport to the Oakland campus, which is roughly 20 miles away. The bus runs from 5:20am to 1:01am every day of the week. The opposite direction is just as convenient and starts at 4:25am with last pickup at 11:51pm. The trip takes about an hour and there are buses every 30 minutes or so. The drive is very scenic and gives you a good feel for all that Pitt has to offer.\n\nThroughout the week students of Serbian, Russian and Bulgarian came together and went on little excursions to pass the free time. The major super market in the area is Giant Eagle (\"Jynt Igel\", if you want to get local). There was one within walking distance of campus, but it was much more of an adventure to take the 61A, 61C or 61D to Squirrel Hill (\"Skvirel\", if you want to get Slavic with it) and shop there. We also preferred this since the main street is lined with Greek, Russian and Jewish stores and restaurants. There is also a good number of family owned arts and crafts shops, handmade goods stores and other small businesses.\n\nIf we were feeling like we really wanted a change of scenery, we'd ride the 61C or 61D farther down SW and cross the Allegheny to Homestead, PA. There is a large shopping center with all the luxuries of corporate America from AMC Loews Waterfront 22 and Target to Chick-Fil-A and Dave & Busters. The distance is only 6 miles, but it always took forever and a day. You're looking at 45 minutes in perfect traffic conditions.\n\nAnother shopping option was the Southside Riverfront. It was a mere 3 mile ride and could be accessed by hopping on the 75 or 54. We rode it many times to visit H&M for cheap clothing and REI to get travel essentials (many students end up going abroad through their respective language programs). This area was also the place to be on weekends and has a number of eateries and dive bars.\n\nOne little known fact about SLI is that you are not saved by the bell. When class is over you are still a student of the linguistic arts and expected to practice as much as possible. This includes lunches with your professors and peers, dinner dates with other students, and cultural excursions. The American Serbian Club was considered the mecca of the language students, regardless of which language they were studying. It is also located in South Side, so the 75 or 54 will get you within blocks of its doorstep. Both run pretty frequently, all day and all night.\n\nBut my absolutely best memory of the Port Authority has to be my first day back in Pittsburgh in 2006. I had decided to skip staying in the dorms and opted to go even cheaper by renting an apartment nearby. I had just arrived and was getting to know my roommates. We went for a walk around campus and ended up somewhere just NW of the school. It started to downpour and as we were scurrying for cover, a little shuttle bus driver pulled over and offered us a ride. We asked him where he was headed and in perfect Pittsburghese he replied, \"Wherever yinz is a goin'.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"},

Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.

Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"},

Can you have degrees of hate...well apparently you can and in this contest the Port Authority wins out marginally - which is why it gets 2 stars rather than 1.\n\nI should clarify, I hate the bus system but don't mind the trolley or \"T\".  But unfortunately, I've been destined to live in an area which only has bus trasport so I've been trying to manage and I'm so fed up with the constant delays and no-shows of the bus I try to take to and from the city.\n\nI have the option to take the G3 or 28X to get to and from the city in a reasonable amount of time.  There are other bus options but from my research they take well over an hour to get to and from the city to the Robinson area.  The G3 and 28X are the only \"express\" options.\n\nThe G3 has been very reliable in my experience but the timings are a bit inconvenient.  They operate from 5 AM something to a little after 8 AM and then resume around 3:00 PM until 7:00 PM during the weekdays only.  So if I need to get a bus after 8:00 AM or before 3:00 PM then this option is out so I have to rely on the 28X.\n\nThe 28X in my experience is constantly delayed or just does't show up and I make use of the schedule and the TrueTime app.  You would think that a bus that runs every 30 minutes could get it together and show up at least within 5-10 minutes of it's supposed scheduled time.  On most days, I wait over 20 minutes sometimes even 40 minutes and most of the time I'm at one of the first stops!  \n\nI wish there was a better transit option in the Pittsburgh area or the infrastrucure of the city (roads, parking, etc.) was improved...I feel like I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"},

Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \"Codfather\" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \"Codfather\" is prepared 3 ways - \"Part 1\" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \"Part 2\" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \"Part 3\" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \"express lunch\" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ"},

While there was a bit too much BBQ sauce on the ribs, they were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone good.  \n\nI was in the mood for a good beer of which they have plenty.  While I normally would order an Abita Purple Haze, I was talked into some shandy that was on special.  Thursday specials are micro-brews - which means that we should really go every Thursday.  But I am getting off track.  When the waitress told me that there were two shandies on tap, she offered to give me a taste of the one in which I wasn't familiar.

I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service.

I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money.

I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  \n\nThe Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!

I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.\n\nMy favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the \"half sandwich and a soup\" deal they call \"express lunch.\"  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.\n\nI remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.

My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp?) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives!

And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.\n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. \n\nThe particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.\n\nAnd when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food. It just wasn't incredibly impressive to me after all the hype I'd heard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ"},

My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  \n\nUnfortunately, as the evening progressed the bouncer began his shift. Sigh.  I'm sorry, but he just wasn't nice. Not that bouncers need to be cuddly, but dang.  We were seated at the table closest to the door, a table which he clearly despises.  He rudely asked us (the two people seated in the outer seats) to move closer into the table when there was really nowhere for us to go; citing that patrons walking in couldn't do so with us sitting there. Lies.  There was plenty of room for anyone to walk anywhere.  He repeatedly got an attitude with one of our guests both vocally and with his body language; going so far as to seat his stool so close to our table that shoulders were touching. Get over yourself, dude.  I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess.

We were there during a breakfast rush. When we walked in the hostess told us that it would be 45 minutes for the kitchen to prepare our food. Since we had known cains for their delicious breakfast, we thought the wait would be worth it. But an hour and fifteen minutes later we get our food.

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food. Service needs to improve but I wll still come back again because the actual meal was tasty and priced right", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ"},

The waitress gave us our check, stated that the manager would not do anything for us for the long wait and she \"did what she could\" and discounted $5 from our $55 bill. HA! We requested to speak with the manager who avoided us for 10 minutes before she came over and made excuses about it being busy and other people ordering specialty items.

On one said their were two huge pieces of garlic toast and on the other was Angel hair pasta tossed in sauce. It was A LOT of food! The sauce on the pasta and chicken was very tasty. Sometimes sauces can be too tomatoey or bland but their sauce was great. The chicken was still juicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. \nMy husband ordered the Mixed Grill with shrimp.

The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh.

It was almost empty when we arrived for a relatively late breakfast, missing out on the commuter crowd. A friendly Greek lady who may have been one of the owners served us promptly and we were perusing the plentiful options before us.\n\nI decided to go with the gyro breakfast burrito which comes with eggs, gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms in a crisp griddled tortilla, and slices of fried potatoes on the side as well as gyro sauce, aka tzatziki. The meat in the burrito was crisp and gravitating towards the dry side of the moisture spectrum, but it had a really good flavour, quite similar to donairs here in Halifax. Although the crisp tortilla added a nice texture to the dish, I would have preferred a soft pita for the sake of being able to eat it with my hands.\n\nThe potatoes were OK at best. Some pieces had nice crisp edges, but their texture was inconsistent and a normal hashbrown or home fry would have been better.\n\nIf I was around for longer, I'd have definitely tried Tom's again, but alas, it'll always be Dor-Stop that holds a place in my heart.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q"},

I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  Walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the Pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nI grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  I ended up ordering a BLT with a side of loaded fries.  While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  All of that is here!\n\nMy food finally arrived and I started to dive into it.  The first thing that popped into my head was, \"why did I order a side of fries?\"  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).\n\nThe waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  Even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  The only gripe I have about this place is the prices.  Some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.\n\n**something to note: they do serve alcohol here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q"},

They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.\n\nIF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. \n\nI was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. \n\nI have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. \n\nI can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. \n\nThis week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. \n\nEveryone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. \n\nGO STEELERS!! You rock my world!

I needed a team that fits my personality, a team that 'clicks'. \n\nSo I did some research and quickly certain teams dropped the list of potential favorites. Besides that I had to get used to the game in all it's aspects. It was a search that took over 4 years looking, checking and searching for that feeling that your team is suppose to give you when they play. That feeling of pain, anger and lost when your team leaves the field defeated, or the feeling of joy, full Ecstasy and invisibility when the team beats it's opponent. \n\nWell it happened in 2004 after almost 5 years of learning the game, researching the teams and most important falling in love with FOOTBALL. It happened in 2004 in Roethlisberger's Rookie Year, I realized the Steelers where a team after my heart. My favorite (43) Polamalu (USC Baby!), like a 'heat seeking missile' going after anything that's getting to close to putting a number on the board. Big Ben a QB that is not afraid to get hurt or hurt you when necessary. \nWilly Parker, always smiling Ward (even when it hurts), the Bus, Harrison (watch out now!), Santonio Holmes, Tomlin (Yes We Can) and all the others that made Steeler FOOTBALL part of my life. \n\nI did not only fall in love with the STEELERS as a team, but also the history of this great team was an important factor. I am still growing in knowledge concerning the game, and becoming more and more familiar with the past and present of the Steelers, but one thing I know for now and for the future; \"I AM A STEELER FAN!\" \n\n......and I can't wait for next season when we face the Titans again and take care of business with Lendale White (for a former USC Trojan you stink!), after what he did to our Terrible Towel, but first let's go to the Super Bowl XLIII and finish the bird.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg"},

In my estimation, there were only 4 offenses in the league that could have exposed the Steeler's 1st overall scoring defense this year - the Packers (obviously), the Saints, the Patriots, and the Eagles.\nThe Steeler's offense was plagued by poor quarterback play. As much as I had defended Ben as the best quarterback in the league for this team, his deficiencies created a deficit that proved to be insurmountable. He had faced some of the league's best defenses and had not given up 2 interceptions all season, which leads me to believe the Pack was the only team in the league capable of shutting down the Steeler's offense so effectively, even with key injuries to their secondary.\n \nIn retrospect, I think the Steelers should have pursued a trade for the first overall draft pick (aka Sam Bradford) for Ben Roethlisberger a bit more aggressively, although the draft picks we had kept by not doing so represent a lot of potential for upcoming years. I think it's very clear that the first priority for the Steelers in next year's draft is at cornerback (even with rookie Crezdon Butler's eventual return), and the secondary will need to improve significantly next year after being so exposed this year in order to be in playoff contention again. To this, I'd have to recommend for the second straight year that #22 William Gay be cut immediately, as he has continually shown that he can not answer the bell and play to the Steelers' standard.\n \nAll in all, it was a good year - with the loss of so many offensive linemen and Aaron Smith to injury, I wouldn't have expected more than a Wild Card berth and possibly a playoff win. 3 rookies had shown significant potential with 3 others being groomed for future stardom, while reacquiring veteran ex-Steelers had a nominal impact on the field (but whose locker room presence may have been more valuable). Getting to the super bowl this year was a bittersweet surprise, which will give the team valuable experience as veteran leaders may potentially leave after this season.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg"},

I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \"Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\"\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days.
