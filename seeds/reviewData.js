The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \"parlor\" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \"weather report\" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!", "business_id_fk": "5"},

It is a sleek, newish building with the cool, polished feel that most Westin's throw down. The Ember Grille was nearly empty at dinnertime, and the environment was cold and stark. You would think something with \"ember\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \"10\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay. The staff was all very pleasant with the exception of the disinterested waiter in the bar; strangest service I may have ever encountered. I think maybe he was trying to pull off some sort of NYC attitude schtick in Charlotte. It was amusing at least. Nice stay, nice location. No MSNBC, this and the waiter cost them a star.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

Check-in/checkout went smoothly and the staff's attention to detail, was very professional, yet not overbearing.\n\nThe lobby/cocktail bar area was very conducive to not only getting together to \"defuse\" after a day of training (great couches!), but this area was also friendly to those who's day cannot pass without hopping on the laptop to check e-mail (many outlets available in the lobby/cocktail area). \n\nI utilized the fitness center early every morning (which was no small task, as it was hard to climb out of bed, as the bed/pilows, were so comfortable!). I have become a \"treadmill snob,\" and one morning, all (6) were being used, so I hopped on the ecliptic (sp.?)  machine. I loved the interior of the fitness center as well. There are also free weights and other equipment available as well. I kept hearing that you had to pay $5 each time, but no one on the fitness staff ever approached me regarding this. \n\nThere is also a spa within the fitness center. I did not utilize this, but other coworker's utilized this opportunity.\n\nWe had our meeting within one of the conference rooms at the hotel. It was nice (modern), although as is usually the case, the room grew too cold on occasion, which was addressed by our staff, but with no noticeable difference.\n\nI noticed each morning, that our facilitator was met by the hotel staff to review the day's agenda, which I was very impressive. \n\nThe rooms were nice. Modern fixtures, with a fairly good-sized bathroom. The lotion and soap were great!\n\nThe Uptown area of Charlotte has grown and there are many great restaurants, within walking distance from the hotel.\n\nI had a great time and would recommend this hotel for a great getaway!", "business_id_fk": "5"},

I will share that all of this is provided to me by my company so I am not actually paying for it myself just as an FYI. \n\nI really would say that this hotel does everything they can. The doormen are always there opening the doors, I am always asked if I need help carrying all my ish, the breakfast menu is amazing ( I personally order the oatmeal - it comes with a sliced banana caramelized on top, and the mixed fruit - blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries!) , the breakfast buffet is equally good, and the staff are always smiling and thanking me for staying there. The beds are amazing and the dual shower heads is a major plus. The most amazing part about this hotel is when I come by at 5:45am on Monday they ALWAYS have a room available where I can check in to, drop off my stuff, crash for a few hours and get ready for work (avoiding the whole get ready in an airport bathroom shenanigans). \n\nThe only two reasons why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because 1) The gym only has three ellipicals, they are outreview_dated and one has a TV which doesn't work (everyone else raved about the gym, maybe i just have high expectations) and 2) the room service dinner menu kind of sucks. The only thing worth getting is the vegetable quesadilla with chicken. They do have a restaurant \"Ember Grill\" which I have not tried (this not eating alone vow is keeping me from good food). \n\nElse, this place is phenomenal.

FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember,\" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business, but when you have a problem there is no one to help you. On my last stay I tried for several hours on an off trying to contact someone about the A/C in the room, or just for information about about some of the amenities. No answer. When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

In traditional Westin form, the appointments are superb, and the workout room was top notch. Note the pool is a narrow lap pool that is 3 feet deep on one end and 4 feet at the deepest.

The place lacks to meet Westin standards on so many levels but overall is a great experience. \n\nThe staff here is the big swing and miss I feel since they seemingly have no clue what is going on and are grumpy. Outside of them the place is spot on but the Westin brings me a higher standard in service. \n\nMy room was fantastic and had a decent view towards the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Room was clean  and spacious and the shower had dual heads (no idea what to do with them but cool). The mini fridge was poorly stocked (things were just thrown in there) which I chalked up to poor service/staffing again. \n\nThe bar is a decent place to hang out and last call was around 12:00am. We ordered a few drinks so we could sit around and talk business for a while but only made it about 30 minutes until someone came and asked us to move into the main lobby. It was kind of rude and frustrating to be asked to move for cleaning when they could of cleaned around us easily or started anywhere else. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was alright but not worth the money they charge you. Best service you will find in the hotel is the valet guys, they were always spot on to get our car and quick to help us out with places to eat and drink, A+ for the entrance department. \n\nThe building looks like it belongs in a ward of Tokyo with a cool architecture and it's on my top places to stay in Charlotte but I really wish they would make some staff changes or train their staff meet Starwood's high standards because they do not currently.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

Stayed 2 nights.  The biggest reason for selecting the hotel was the fact it is directly beside the convention center.  And upon arrival, it was clear this was the typical Westin experience.  \n\nThis is a really fine hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, the head bellman was actually better than some bellmen at other Westins I have stayed in, and the staff professionalism continued to the check-in staff.  So that was a little surprise. The Westins near ORD, SFO, and DFW are not quite as polished in my opinion (but still good).\n\nHad a room with a view of the city center.  Which was good, because this hotel sits just on the edge of downtown and just across the interstate in the other direction are strip clubs (so the quality of community drops of pretty quick).  But toward the city it is fairly close to good dining and nightlife.  No need to bother with a car unless you're headed out to get in a round of golf.\n\nParking fee was a bit steep, $25 per day for valet.  I think I recall $18 for self parking.  I actually ended up getting billed for both, but called and they took care of it.\n\nVery nice in hotel dining and bar, as would be expected.  The bar is quite open to the lobby lounge with high ceiling.  And the bar staff are very easy on the eyes.  Additionally, the property is fairly new, so art and architecture feel very modern.

For some, it might seem too 'far' from downtown (3 blocks), but for me it's in great location. Walk to everything, including the Stadium, Convention Center, Downtown, and the Epicenter. \n\nService is great - I would expect it! It's the Westin! From the time you get out of a scorching hot taxi (even with air conditioning on) up until the time you leave at 6 in the morning 3 days later. I haven't experience a single hiccup (except a spider in my bathtub that scared the hell out of me one night). \n\nAmenities are great:\n\nRoom - 4 stars. Last time I was here, I got a room with a great walking shower bathroom. This time, it was the regular small bathroom. Last time, my friend managed to get a room with a treadmill (yes, they exist!), this time they were all sold out. I got stuck on the 6th floor, she got stuck on the fourth floor. This was an upgrade for me, as last time I was on the 4th floor as well. Ok, enough bitching. The rooms are great. Beds are called heavenly for a reason and all the condiments and towels and sheets are so fresh you feel energized be mere being in the room. Air Conditioning is a bit loud so either turn if off for the night or bring ear plugs.\n\nGym - 5 stars. From the variety of the workout options to the gym facilities - everything screams class. Perfectomundo! Individual TV screens for every machine (bike, elliptical, treadmill) help time pass by while working out and watching \"True Blood\" on HBO. Hmmm. Plenty of channels to choose from, though. Sauna, showers, and the locker room are squeaky clean with plenty of extra shampoo, lotion and mouth wash.\n\nPool - 3 stars. Even though this is a great big lap pool, it's too shallow - only 3  1/2 feet deep. I understand that they don't want kids to drown there if unattended, but come on, waist-deep pool is not very appealing to me.\n\nEmber Grill - 4 stars. I have only been here for breakfast - I can't complain, except for the prices. $18 for breakfast is a little steep. However, you can eat all you want from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and nobody will kick you out (not that I have done that, I swear!).\n\nBusiness Center - 1 star. Ok, what they call a business center is actually a 50 square foot room with 3 workstations, a printer and a fax machine. Internet is pay-per-minute, except to check in on your airline's website and print the boarding pass (which was actually all I needed from the Business Center). However, for travelers who actually need a business center - better bring the laptop and stay in your room with $12.95/day internet service.\n\nAirport Transportation - 5 stars. Checking out at 4 a.m.? Take advantage of the flat rate towncar that will take you directly to the airport. Air-conditioned bliss!\n\nOk, let's summarize: I would give this hotel a solid 4 stars and would definitely stay here again.

I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.\n\nI'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.\n\nThe rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.\n\nI also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.\n\nMy only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.\n\nExpect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.

Also, the driveway can get a bit crowded when trying to pick up, drop off or just get into the self-park area.   During our last visit,  Michael Jordan was staying here.  The hotel staff parked his car in the drive next to the bellman, so it could be watched around the clock, which made the small driveway to pick up & drop off guests even smaller.

I asked if I could get my parking valireview_dated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour.

Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.\n\nFor a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.\n\nThe staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.\n\nInternet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.\n\nThe gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a \"refresh area\" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.\n\nAs for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference.  Caterting was done right near the escalators.\n\nI didn't eat the restaurants on location since most of the meals were taken care of by the conference but I did check it price... and I would definitely venture out and explore the city a bit.  For the same price, I could probably check out a nice steakhouse around the area.\n\nWould definitely try to stay here again next time if I'm able to visit Charlotte again!", "business_id_fk": "5"},

The employee stated she would send someone from security up.  A few minutes later, the guitar music briefly stopped.  However, it started up again soon after. Again, we called down to the front desk, explained the issue at hand, & was given the same response. The music continued.  Around 4:15, my boyfriend got out of bed, went downstairs & pleaded for some assistance.  Again, he was told that security would come.  No one came.  Around 4:30 / 4:45 AM, he called the front desk again & was told the issue was \"pending & that meant it was taken care of\". Unfortunately, \"pending\" in normal circumstances does not mean \"taken care of\".  My boyfriend waited at our door to ensure someone was in fact coming to handle this noise complaint.  Finally at around 5 AM, security came, knocked on their door & asked them to \"keep it down\". It was at that point, there was silence.\n\nWas it necessary we had to go through all this?

This still seems expensive, but it was a popular weekend so we didn't shop around much more.\n\nThe wait for the elevators was ridiculous! I guess that there's not much that can be done about such a thing, but waiting for 10 minutes at a time because every elevator that stops is FULL TO THE BRIM with people was annoying. At once point, my husband took the stairs back to our room WHICH WAS ON THE ELEVENTH FLOOR after visiting the Starbucks in the lobby. Oh, and it's not a full Starbucks so they didn't even have iced coffee...???\n\nThe room was nice- we were on the end of a hallway, which I had heard was good because of the views and tons of windows. There were a ton of windows, but they overlooked construction and highways. Meh. The shower/bathtub situation was pretty awesome, also with tons of windows (there were shades, if you wished to pull them down!). There seemed to be no fan in the bathroom, though, which surprised me. \n\nAlso, there was a burnt out bulb in the bathroom, right near the magnifying mirror; when we called down to the front desk to have it replaced they said it would take them a while...and it did. Also, this is a small thing, but they put lotion in the shower instead of shampoo (next to the conditioner). So I washed my hair with lotion. Yeah.\n\nWe visited the bar on Saturday night between 10 and 11 and it was insane. It took us 40 minutes to get a drink, which we expected, but people behind us were being served first! I guess that's our fault for not being savvy enough to know how to get served in bars? Also, one bartender with red curly hair was making drinks kind of ridiculously- packing more ice in when she ran out of something and choosing things at random to pour in the glasses. We were glad the the person who finally served us (our overpriced cocktails) seemed to be measuring a little more carefully.\n\nA few more details: Parking is $18 and they bill it to your room; pretty standard for a downtown Charlotte hotel, but not exactly a welcome charge on your bill. The pool is inside. Someone on Yelp said that there is a rooftop bar at the Westin, but they must have gotten rid of it because we were told there was no such thing when we asked.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I prefer the Courtyard Marriot a few blocks over, on Tryon.

This year was smaller than the past due I think mostly because people are not happy with the continued issues of under staffing at the bar.  It took about 30 min to get a drink, and once again they ran out of vodka.  I would think because of past experiences with this group they would be better prepared.  There was so much lost revenue, last night because I saw a lot of people including my group that just left and went elsewhere to get a drink.\n\nThe main bathroom off the lobby was one of the most disgusting I have encountered.  one stall was roped off with no toilet at all,  there was  a broken bottle in the other shattered all over the floor, no towels, and one had overflowed.  Wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion.\n\nMy recemendation is step it up Westin,  I assure you I wont be back unless you do..I hope this group considers another venue, want that wants the business, as it seems the westin is not interested..", "business_id_fk": "5"},

While I expect the room rates to vary based on location, brand, etc... I am always shocked by the varying price of additional services at Westin properties.  Parking at this hotel is a virtual deal breaker at over $20/night.  The hotel itself is very nice, with solid amenities; however, is a bit isolated from any restaurants or stores to grab something quick.  As a result, the hotel charges for room service border on absurd.  An omelette w/ OJ will run you around $35 by the time they are done over charging for eggs and cheese, plus a service fee, plus 18% forced gratuity, plus whatever other fees are required.  The gym is outstanding, as far as hotel gyms generally go, though a whirlpool would have been a nice addition.  The rooms are comfortable, clean, and generally sheltered from noise.  I stay here weekly due to the proximity to my client, but I do so reluctantly.  I'd consider giving this hotel 4, perhaps even 5 stars, if I didn't feel fleeced every time I ordered something to the room or parked my car.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

Westin hotels are also known for their comfortable beds though I personally do not notice much of a difference compared to Marriotts.  The Westin in Downtown Charlotte definitely delivered on Westin's contemporary image and comfortable rooms.\n\nThe rooms are not incredibly modern, but they are contemporary and have a simple and good neutral color scheme.  The design is definitely a notch above a lot of Marriotts that often feature an unappealing color scheme and ugly carpets.  The bed at this Westin was comfortable--excellent linen too and a comfortable room temperature.  The bathroom had a great look and featured a rainfall showerhead.  While I do not have status with Starwood, I did like the nice touch of two complimentary bottles of water with each night (it seems every Starwood member, even non-elite members, enjoy this benefit).\n\nThis Westin also has a great location.  It is right on College, which leads to several Downtown Charlotte restaurants and even some of Charlotte's nightlife like a dance club and a dueling piano bar.  This Westin is also within walking distance to several key Charlotte attractions including a minor league baseball stadium, the Carolina Panthers (NFL) stadium, the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) arena, and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nThe fitness center was big and had several machines.\n\nThe lobby was nice too.  It was spacious and there were several sitting areas if you are waiting for someone.\n\nI tried a little bit of their catering for a nightly event in their restaurant as well as in one of their banquet rooms for breakfast.  The food was definitely subpar for a Westin.  A lot of it was due to poor preparation and the effects of having buffet style food as the scrambled eggs were not that fluffy, the waffles were very soft and the flatbread was limp (it had definitely been sitting around for too long).\n\nService throughout the hotel was friendly though I felt that housekeeping was a tad slow to service my room on some days.\n\nPrices are high, but the hotel is nice and the location is very convenient.\n\nFor travelers looking to explore Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a great option.  The rooms are nice and the location is near perfect.  Downtown Charlotte is not my favorite downtown city.  It is a tad sleepy though not as quiet as Phoenix or as small as San Jose.

I must say it was hard to leave! \n\nHotel:\n\nThe Westin is right in Uptown located across from the Convention Center and next to a light rail station, The Epicentre is only a 10-minute walk away (yes, we braved the cold, but it was nice!), and the arena is another few minutes from there. You can pay $25 for valet parking or $18 to self-park (which we did).\n\nThe lobby area was nice, and check-in was smooth. There is a mini-Starbucks there and a gift/sundries shop around the corner. The elevator bank has six elevators, so we didn't have to wait long (except when we ran into the ACN International Convention attendants coming back from the arena!).\n\nRestaurant/Food Service:\n\nWe didn't eat at the restaurant or indulge in food service, but apparently the breakfast buffet isn$25 per person! If you're here on a Sunday like we were, check out Pike's Soda Shop (a five-minute drive away in South End) for their amazing breakfast and breakfast buffet for $8.95 (before 10am--after that it's $13.95, but they add more food).\n\nRoom:\n\nWe booked a corner Superior room on the 23rd floor with gorgeous views of Uptown. It faced north and east, so the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. There is a nice-sized TV, individual thermostat, a desk with chair, an armchair with ottoman, a mini-fridge, and a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. They even threw in two free bottles of water (but don't consume the third, or it's $3.95). We didn't hair any noise from neighbors besides one instance of dogs barking (yes, the Westin is pet friendly). If you choose no housekeeping each day you're there (excluding day of departure), you get hooked up with a $5 dining voucher you can keep (or you can exchange that for 500 Starwood points when you check out). We initially had a problem with a non-functioning remote for the TV, but they sent someone up within 15 minutes and took care of it. Also beware that Wifi isn't free, but I believe if you're an SPG member you may not have to pay.\n\nBed:\n\nThe Heavenly Bed definitely lived up to its name! It was extremely comfortable and hard to get out of. The pillows were a little too soft for my taste, but if you love very soft pillows you're in for a treat! The duvet and sheets are comfortable as well. If you have a corner room, be aware there is a window right behind the bed. It wasn't a big deal with the blackout curtains.\n\nBathroom:\n\nThe bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom (no exhaust fan, unfortunately). The Heavenly Shower was awesome! It's both a rainfall-type shower, and there is a nice handheld component to it. My only gripe was the bathtub didn't drain well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all we had an amazing stay! I highly recommend this hotel. This was our second time staying here, and we will definitely return. :)", "business_id_fk": "5"},

First off, I was staying here for a conference and had requested a higher floor room, but was given a 4th floor room - which is the lowest floor for rooms. I had also requested a King size bed since my wife was travelling with me, but we were given two double beds. In addition to not being able to sleep with my wife during the stay, I couldn't even fit comfortably on the bed (I'm 6' 4\" so I always get a King bed). But I usually don't make a fuss about these kind of things when I'm at conference because I'm not paying for it anyway. The room itself was just okay - nothing wrong with it, but perhaps the most underwhelming room I've ever had at a supposedly luxury hotel. The only positive is that the bed itself was comfortable - would have been nice to have that King bed though, of course. \n\nMany of the hotel staff seemed rude and inappropriate in situations - including the onsite Hertz staff. Obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location. Plus I had went to the front desk to get my key card \"keyed\" for use in the parking garage because I had rented a car there, but they couldn't even manage to get this right. I never could get the key card to work in the parking garage. \n\nConference rooms were poorly set-up, freezing cold, and loud! The walls were paper thin and it was at times very difficult to hear the presentations because sound from the other presentations next door would drift through - this was especially a problem in the back of the conference rooms. Attendees often were left standing at the back of the room because not enough chairs were set up.\n\nPerhaps for Charlotte this is a nice property, but for those of us who have traveled around a bit, this place falls very far short on the luxury scale. If you are in Charlotte for travel and have an option to choose where to stay, I'd recommend the much nicer looking Hilton down the street - that's a nice looking property and Hilton is always good. \n\nNot recommended.", "business_id_fk": "5"},

Since arriving here for the first time for a convention in 08', followed b subsequent conventions and business meetings, the Westin Charlotte has been a welcoming accommodation that continues to leave an impression after each visit.\n\nThe first impression easily was the Heavenly beds. I've never slept in a better bed in a hotel prior to this visit, nor since. This bed set the benchmark so high with me that I purchased a comparable model a couple of years later at a pretty penny. The rooms within the Westin Charlotte are standard Westin: a littler smaller than expected, with the bed dominating a good portion of the space. The standard amenities of the pool area, gym and so forth met expectations. The front desk staff is very, very good, in addition to the banquet staff when it comes to accommodating colleagues that are in for a convention. \n\nThe bar area across the floor from the front desk is one of my favorite places to network with professionals as much as I do drink. Known as \"The Lobby Bar\", the area is set up strictly as one to rendezvous with business associates and friends during events primarily after 5 PM. The menu is moderately reasonable for beer drafts, yet a little pricier for hors d' oeuvres and cocktails. If you can get your company to approve drinks and appetizers under T&E, it is highly advised. \n\nParking is so-so. While the convenience to park within the underground lot is appreciated, I really think that it should be marked better with regard to where the elevator is in relation to the section of where your car is. It took me nearly 20 minutes to find my car at one point!\n\nAltogether, the Westin Charlotte can be a place to really enjoy.

The customer service is awesome but they need to  follow what their menu says. Other than that I had a great time.

I didn't see a single cockroach.\n\nLike any large metro hotel you'll see a interesting variety of people - business peeps for a conference, kids on a tour all wearing the same coordinated clothes, and random weirdos (like me).

People watching is a sport in itself - all the tarted up ladies (welcome to The South y'all) and kids freaking out.\n\nLets talk about the bar.

I'm gonna like this place, I thought - I wonder if the locals come here knowing the drinks are strong. But alas... the SECOND night I ordered a whisky sour and it was basically sour mix.

(It's saved me more than once when, say, I realize that I forgot to grab my umbrella and have to run back into my apartment.) \n\nThe main problem is when there are holes in the schedule where a scheduled bus just never arrives, probably due to technical problems. That's happened to me at least once per month, but it's not so pervasive as to be a major issue.\n\nAll in all, I've found the buses to be dependable and convenient.

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\"Miss Pat\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \"free\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \"oughts\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \"busways,\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \"T\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \"smart card\" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.", "business_id_fk": "4"},

Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  \n2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching\n3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.\n\nPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!

I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university, in an effort to accommoreview_date out-of-state students as much as possible, provided \"free\" bus passes (these were factored into your cost of attending). With my full scholarship and pass, I had every intention of keeping this trip on the cheap by walking everywhere I could and using public trans for everything else.\n\nMy first experience with the Port Authority was taking the 28X Airport Flyer from the International Airport to the Oakland campus, which is roughly 20 miles away. The bus runs from 5:20am to 1:01am every day of the week. The opposite direction is just as convenient and starts at 4:25am with last pickup at 11:51pm. The trip takes about an hour and there are buses every 30 minutes or so. The drive is very scenic and gives you a good feel for all that Pitt has to offer.\n\nThroughout the week students of Serbian, Russian and Bulgarian came together and went on little excursions to pass the free time. The major super market in the area is Giant Eagle (\"Jynt Igel\", if you want to get local). There was one within walking distance of campus, but it was much more of an adventure to take the 61A, 61C or 61D to Squirrel Hill (\"Skvirel\", if you want to get Slavic with it) and shop there. We also preferred this since the main street is lined with Greek, Russian and Jewish stores and restaurants. There is also a good number of family owned arts and crafts shops, handmade goods stores and other small businesses.\n\nIf we were feeling like we really wanted a change of scenery, we'd ride the 61C or 61D farther down SW and cross the Allegheny to Homestead, PA. There is a large shopping center with all the luxuries of corporate America from AMC Loews Waterfront 22 and Target to Chick-Fil-A and Dave & Busters. The distance is only 6 miles, but it always took forever and a day. You're looking at 45 minutes in perfect traffic conditions.\n\nAnother shopping option was the Southside Riverfront. It was a mere 3 mile ride and could be accessed by hopping on the 75 or 54. We rode it many times to visit H&M for cheap clothing and REI to get travel essentials (many students end up going abroad through their respective language programs). This area was also the place to be on weekends and has a number of eateries and dive bars.\n\nOne little known fact about SLI is that you are not saved by the bell. When class is over you are still a student of the linguistic arts and expected to practice as much as possible. This includes lunches with your professors and peers, dinner review_dates with other students, and cultural excursions. The American Serbian Club was considered the mecca of the language students, regardless of which language they were studying. It is also located in South Side, so the 75 or 54 will get you within blocks of its doorstep. Both run pretty frequently, all day and all night.\n\nBut my absolutely best memory of the Port Authority has to be my first day back in Pittsburgh in 2006. I had decided to skip staying in the dorms and opted to go even cheaper by renting an apartment nearby. I had just arrived and was getting to know my roommates. We went for a walk around campus and ended up somewhere just NW of the school. It started to downpour and as we were scurrying for cover, a little shuttle bus driver pulled over and offered us a ride. We asked him where he was headed and in perfect Pittsburghese he replied, \"Wherever yinz is a goin'.\"", "business_id_fk": "4"},

Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.

Every single bus stop in downtown had about 300 people waiting for the already overcrowded buses.

Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.", "business_id_fk": "4"},

Can you have degrees of hate...well apparently you can and in this contest the Port Authority wins out marginally - which is why it gets 2 stars rather than 1.\n\nI should clarify, I hate the bus system but don't mind the trolley or \"T\".  But unfortunately, I've been destined to live in an area which only has bus trasport so I've been trying to manage and I'm so fed up with the constant delays and no-shows of the bus I try to take to and from the city.\n\nI have the option to take the G3 or 28X to get to and from the city in a reasonable amount of time.  There are other bus options but from my research they take well over an hour to get to and from the city to the Robinson area.  The G3 and 28X are the only \"express\" options.\n\nThe G3 has been very reliable in my experience but the timings are a bit inconvenient.  They operate from 5 AM something to a little after 8 AM and then resume around 3:00 PM until 7:00 PM during the weekdays only.  So if I need to get a bus after 8:00 AM or before 3:00 PM then this option is out so I have to rely on the 28X.\n\nThe 28X in my experience is constantly delayed or just does't show up and I make use of the schedule and the TrueTime app.  You would think that a bus that runs every 30 minutes could get it together and show up at least within 5-10 minutes of it's supposed scheduled time.  On most days, I wait over 20 minutes sometimes even 40 minutes and most of the time I'm at one of the first stops!  \n\nI wish there was a better transit option in the Pittsburgh area or the infrastrucure of the city (roads, parking, etc.) was improved...I feel like I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place.", "business_id_fk": "4"},

Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \"Codfather\" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \"Codfather\" is prepared 3 ways - \"Part 1\" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \"Part 2\" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \"Part 3\" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \"express lunch\" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings.", "business_id_fk": "3"},

I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless!

The bartender was attentive and I never had a problem getting his attention if I needed anything. The food was good, it was served fast, and the portions were huge as usual.

I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.\n\nMy favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the \"half sandwich and a soup\" deal they call \"express lunch.\"  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.\n\nI remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a review_date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.

We bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit them all. I called on a Wednesday in February one afternoon asking what time they served breakfast on Sunday's. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp?) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives! The wait staff was super friendly and extremely kind. When we got our bill we were told that Joey had gotten our first round of drinks! Way to go Cain's!

And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.\n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. \n\nThe particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.\n\nAnd when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food.

This was my first visit and I was blown away by the extensive menu and attentive service.  I ordered the Shrimp and Strawberry salad - not something I would usually order at a bar.  But I was not disappointed! The shrimp were of a decent size and seasoned well. The salad was huge and at $12 was just right.  My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  \n\nUnfortunately, as the evening progressed the bouncer began his shift. Sigh.  I'm sorry, but he just wasn't nice. Not that bouncers need to be cuddly, but dang.  We were seated at the table closest to the door, a table which he clearly despises.  He rudely asked us (the two people seated in the outer seats) to move closer into the table when there was really nowhere for us to go; citing that patrons walking in couldn't do so with us sitting there. Lies.  There was plenty of room for anyone to walk anywhere.  He repeatedly got an attitude with one of our guests both vocally and with his body language; going so far as to seat his stool so close to our table that shoulders were touching. Get over yourself, dude.  I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess.

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise.

While we prefer to sit at the bar we knew this would end up being a dining room trip based on the ongoing March Madness and the time we got there (Happy Hour). Our wait to be seated was really short and even the tables (rather than booths) feel roomy in the dining room. There are approximately 100 giant TVs inside between the bar and dining room. Well, ok, maybe not 100... but it's close maybe 97 TVs. This is a great place to watch whatever Sportball game your into, even in the dining room. \n\nAs soon as we were seated it started to really fill up. The place looks small but it fits a lot of people. While waiting for our waitress to come get our drink order I saw they used an online listing for the over 30 on tap craft beers. I love this because it allowed us to decide before she even got to us. They have a happy hour special of half price appetizers and Wednesday's are wing night. \n\nWe both ordered wings; mine boneless and his bone in (it's ok you can laugh, I'm 12 too). They took a while to come out due to how busy they were but they were so delicious.

On one said their were two huge pieces of garlic toast and on the other was Angel hair pasta tossed in sauce. It was A LOT of food! The sauce on the pasta and chicken was very tasty.

It was almost empty when we arrived for a relatively late breakfast, missing out on the commuter crowd. A friendly Greek lady who may have been one of the owners served us promptly and we were perusing the plentiful options before us.\n\nI decided to go with the gyro breakfast burrito which comes with eggs, gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms in a crisp griddled tortilla, and slices of fried potatoes on the side as well as gyro sauce, aka tzatziki. The meat in the burrito was crisp and gravitating towards the dry side of the moisture spectrum, but it had a really good flavour, quite similar to donairs here in Halifax. Although the crisp tortilla added a nice review_texture to the dish, I would have preferred a soft pita for the sake of being able to eat it with my hands.\n\nThe potatoes were OK at best.

I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.

While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.

The first thing that popped into my head was, \"why did I order a side of fries?\"  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).\n\nThe waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.

They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls.

If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. \n\nI was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. \n\nI have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. \n\nI can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. \n\nThis week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. \n\nEveryone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl.

Besides that I had to get used to the game in all it's aspects. It was a search that took over 4 years looking, checking and searching for that feeling that your team is suppose to give you when they play. That feeling of pain, anger and lost when your team leaves the field defeated, or the feeling of joy, full Ecstasy and invisibility when the team beats it's opponent. \n\nWell it happened in 2004 after almost 5 years of learning the game, researching the teams and most important falling in love with FOOTBALL. It happened in 2004 in Roethlisberger's Rookie Year, I realized the Steelers where a team after my heart. My favorite (43) Polamalu (USC Baby!), like a 'heat seeking missile' going after anything that's getting to close to putting a number on the board. Big Ben a QB that is not afraid to get hurt or hurt you when necessary. \nWilly Parker, always smiling Ward (even when it hurts), the Bus, Harrison (watch out now!), Santonio Holmes, Tomlin (Yes We Can) and all the others that made Steeler FOOTBALL part of my life. \n\nI did not only fall in love with the STEELERS as a team, but also the history of this great team was an important factor.

The pick off of Tony Romo for the game winning touchdown, the domination against the Patriots, the strange 11-10 victory against the Chargers during the regular season, the crazy Troy Polamalu interceptions, the jaw breaking block by Hines Ward, the Ryan Clark hits, James Harrison becoming Defensive MVP, the big 2 minute drive against the Cardinals, Santonio Holmes big plays, Big Bens amazing ability to scramble and make big plays, the Steelers #1 Defense, the mediocre O-line (HAHA who has the last laugh now), and of course, Mike Tomlin, the man that kept the team focused and made everything happen.\n\nYou guys are the very reason why I love football.\n\nThank you for such a great season.\n___________________\n\n+1.

In my estimation, there were only 4 offenses in the league that could have exposed the Steeler's 1st overall scoring defense this year - the Packers (obviously), the Saints, the Patriots, and the Eagles.\nThe Steeler's offense was plagued by poor quarterback play. As much as I had defended Ben as the best quarterback in the league for this team, his deficiencies created a deficit that proved to be insurmountable. He had faced some of the league's best defenses and had not given up 2 interceptions all season, which leads me to believe the Pack was the only team in the league capable of shutting down the Steeler's offense so effectively, even with key injuries to their secondary.\n \nIn retrospect, I think the Steelers should have pursued a trade for the first overall draft pick (aka Sam Bradford) for Ben Roethlisberger a bit more aggressively, although the draft picks we had kept by not doing so represent a lot of potential for upcoming years. I think it's very clear that the first priority for the Steelers in next year's draft is at cornerback (even with rookie Crezdon Butler's eventual return), and the secondary will need to improve significantly next year after being so exposed this year in order to be in playoff contention again. To this, I'd have to recommend for the second straight year that #22 William Gay be cut immediately, as he has continually shown that he can not answer the bell and play to the Steelers' standard.\n \nAll in all, it was a good year - with the loss of so many offensive linemen and Aaron Smith to injury, I wouldn't have expected more than a Wild Card berth and possibly a playoff win. 3 rookies had shown significant potential with 3 others being groomed for future stardom, while reacquiring veteran ex-Steelers had a nominal impact on the field (but whose locker room presence may have been more valuable). Getting to the super bowl this year was a bittersweet surprise, which will give the team valuable experience as veteran leaders may potentially leave after this season.", "business_id_fk": "1"},

I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \"Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\"\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days.

I would love it if Whole Foods sold non-frozen Ezekiel's bread. \n\nI actually buy  a lot of basics here and some of them end up being cheaper than  Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.\n\nThings I always buy at Whole Foods and no where else, bec. I have found it way better in price/quality:\n-365 Brand Tofu (MUCH better that Trader Joe's tofu that has  weird review_texture)\n-365 Brand dried beans/canned beans\n-365 Brand butter (no BST)\n-365 Brand Edamame (is far better than Trader Joe's Edamame which has a strange smell).\n-365 Brand whole wheat flour\n\nOf course I prefer Trader Joe's for their peanut butter(bec. it has no salt) and Ezekiel's bread. And I do end up buying their coffee, bec. it's slightly cheaper than the Allegro Coffee at Whole Foods. However, the Allegro Ethiopian Harrar is quite good.", "business_id_fk": "10"},

Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.\n\nIf you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:\n\n1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.\n\n2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).\n\n3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.\n\n5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.\n\n6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...\n\nI don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here.

I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately \"overpriced,\" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.\n\nThis is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.\n\nI wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.\n\nAnd yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?

Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. \n\nFirst, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, \"When I'm done\". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an \"ok\" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. \n\nSecond, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....\n\nSo two review_stars docked for the above mentioned.

I will tell you why.\n\nMany Yelpers have docked review_stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.\n\nThe Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. \n\nWhole Foods has that \"whole paycheck\" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \n\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\n\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!", "business_id_fk": "10"},

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).\nI don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not \"rich\" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\nI also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.\nMy love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.\nMy favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.\nWe also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  \nThe secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.\nI love Whole Foods.  It's the reason we chose to move to ShadySide.", "business_id_fk": "10"},

I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \"workers\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you!

Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents.

I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. \n\nA few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.\n\nMonths have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me \"the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made\" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. \n\nAnd everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too.

I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right review_texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable.

Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\n\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on).

Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy.

The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR.

I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\" that has the BEST real chicken review_texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B!

I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the \"typical\" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled \"best snacks at whole foods\" to get some more ideas of what to try. \n\nNow here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. \n\nHaving said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! \n\nAlthough whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! \n\nThe customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. \n\nas other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare.

It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. \nThe bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.\nThe meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. \nStaff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.\nSalad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. \nI usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive). \nLines at the registers can be long but seem to move fast. People complain so much about how crazy busy this place is, but they have obviously just never been to the whole foods in Columbus circle NYC.", "business_id_fk": "10"},

I know that I will get a good lunch or dinner, and the price is comparable to most upscale fast food options.    A few weeks ago I was really sick and came in to pick up a cold remedy, lunch, and orange juice.  This Whole Foods is just not quite up to the national standard.\n\nFirst, this Whole Foods is fairly small, but the parking situation is a disaster.  There is not adequate parking, and the kind of people who shop at this particular Whole Foods are the worst people ever.  People will try to run you over in the parking lot to get the last spot.  It's actually pathetic.\n\nThe store is set-up a bit odd, and the employees aren't particularly friendly here.  I felt like I was begging someone to find Sambucus, which just isn't fun when you don't feel well.  However, the cashiers were up to par.\n\nThe biggest kick in the face was the prepared foods section.  At 11:00 AM on a Thursday there was no prepared food set up.  No soup, no entrees.  Just some leftover Oatmeal that had hardened from breakfast and the name tags for the prepared food that would eventually come out.  There are only two small serving stations as well, and a lot of my favorite options were missing, like the mac and cheese.\n\nIf you are just looking to do standard grocery shopping here, then this Whole Foods is just fine.  The grocery selections were pretty standard, and the aisles are wide enough.  This Whole Foods is a big step up from the gross Market District down the street, but the standard is pretty low here as well.", "business_id_fk": "10"},

The hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good. When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was elated to finally have a Whole Foods I could shop at! \n\nBut the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? \n\nAnd, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. \n\nAnd I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't). Especially not after the parking lot.\n\nEDIT: Well, customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey. I amend to 3*... thanks customer service!", "business_id_fk": "10"},

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten.

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.\n\nI found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.\n\nTheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?\n\nI have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/", "business_id_fk": "9"},

Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.\n\nSome of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous.

Unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --\n\nNow, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question \"wet or dry\" a thousand times. Sometimes a \"wet cap\" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.\n\nPerhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it.

Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants.

No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in.

This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).", "business_id_fk": "8"},

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.", "business_id_fk": "8"},

My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.\n\nThe table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze.

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it.

And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.\n\nOur server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.\n\nI ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and \"lobster pot pie.\"  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\n\nThe lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  \n\nSo everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.\n\nI'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.", "business_id_fk": "7"},

The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the review_stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down.

Very cozy.  Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.  Most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  But this is Pittsburgh and this is seafood.\n\nThat said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  Butter was soft which I like.  Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.

Mitchell's used to have a great menu and I've always been thrilled with my selections.  I don't know what changed, but it was something.  I ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables.   The portion was ample, but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasn't crispy at all.

Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story).

I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.", "business_id_fk": "6"},

I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. \n\nWell I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. \n\nPart of this is my fault...I always order \"healthy\" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  \n\nI started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it.

He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.

You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!

I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.

Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.

Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\n\nMy wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\n\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\n\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \n\nThe kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen.

He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.

The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \n\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons.

They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\n\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks.

My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. \nI had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. \nI would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.", "business_id_fk": "6"},
